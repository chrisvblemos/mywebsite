    <p>Hello, I'm Christian Lemos. I have a Bsc. degree in Theoretical Physics. 
    I've attended a Master's degree in Mathematics for 2 years, but I had 
    to drop out due to financial difficuties at the time. Since then, I've been 
    spending most of my time reading and experimenting with computers and 
    programming languages. I've decided to make this personal website after 
    hearing about <a href="https://landchad.net/">LandChad</a> from a close friend. Don't expect 
    too much from reading things in here, you'll probably unlearn stuff and 
    get confused by my rants.</p>
